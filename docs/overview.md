# Monty - a stackless VM for µCs

**Monty** is a Virtual Machine which runs bytecode produced by [MicroPython][MPY].<br/>
It's grossly incomplete and totally unfit for general use, but ... it _does_ work.<br/>
There is no compiler, this VM uses `.mpy` files generated by `mpy-cross`.

?> **Feb 2021** - This project is in its early stages and has limited
documentation.
