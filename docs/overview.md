# Monty - a stackless VM

**Monty** is a Virtual Machine which runs bytecode produced by [MicroPython][MPY].<br/>
It's grossly incomplete and totally unfit for general use, but ... it _does_ work.<br/>
There is no compiler, this VM uses `.mpy` files generated by `mpy-cross`.

?> **January 2021** - This project is in its **very** early stages.  
There's almost no documentation ... just what's on the following pages:

* [Development » Getting started](dev/getting-started)
* [Architecture » Objects and vectors](arch/objects-and-vectors)
* [Architecture » Data structures](arch/data-structures)
* [Architecture » Stacklets & Coros](arch/stacklets-coros)
* [Source code » Conventions](src/conventions)
* [Source code » monty/gc.cpp](src/monty-gc)
