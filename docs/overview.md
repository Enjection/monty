# Monty - a stackless VM

?> **January 2021** - This project is in its **very** early stages.  
There's almost no documentation ... just what's on on this page.

**Monty** is a Virtual Machine which runs bytecode produced by [MicroPython][MPY].<br/>
It's grossly incomplete and totally unfit for general use, but ... it _does_ work.<br/>
There is no compiler, this VM uses `.mpy` files generated by `mpy-cross`.

This project is written from the ground up in C++, but it would not exist without  
the huge amount of thought and work put into the development of MicroPython,  
which proves that a modern dynamic language can run well on embedded µCs.

The reason for creating this project, is to explore some stackless design ideas.

The source code & docs are in the public domain and under active development.  

?> The following pages contain some more information (it's all work-in-progress):
* [Development » Getting started](dev/getting-started)
* [Source code » Conventions](src/conventions)
