**Monty** is a Virtual Machine which executes bytecode generated by [MicroPython][MPY].  
It's grossly incomplete and totally unfit for general use, but it _does_ work.  
There is no compiler, this VM requires an `.mpy` file from `mpy-cross` to run.  

This C++ library is written from the ground up, but it would not exist without  
the huge amount of thought and work put into the development of MicroPython,  
which proves that a modern dynamic language can run well on embedded ÂµCs.

The reason for creating this project, is to explore some stackless design ideas.

See `apps/native/` for details - **this directory structure is still in flux.**
