## Monty: a stackless Python VM

This is a virtual machine which executes bytecode generated by [MicroPython][MPY].  
It's grossly incomplete and totally unfit for general use, but it _does_ work.  
There is no compiler, **Monty** requires an `.mpy` file from `mpy-cross` to run.  

This C++ library is written from the ground up, but it would not exist without  
the huge amount of thought and work put into the development of MicroPython,  
which proves that a modern dynamic language can run well on embedded ÂµCs.

The reason for creating this project, is to explore some stackless design ideas.

See <https://git.jeelabs.org/jcw/pythonx/src/branch/master/toypy> for a main app.
