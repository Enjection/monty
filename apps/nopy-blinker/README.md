Connect a [Nucleo-L432KC][L432] as follows:

The 6 extra LEDs on A0..A5 each have a series resistor, and A6 is tied to GND.

To build and run (this echos the underlying cmd used to do the work):

```text
$ inv
Processing nucleo-l432 (board: nucleo_l432kc; platform: ststm32; framework: cmsis)
$
```

All the LEDs will start blinking, each one at a different rate.  
The on-board LED will blink even if no other LEDs are connected.
